# Cauldron

**Build recipes. Test logic. Stay organized.**  
Cauldron is a visual recipe editor for game developers — build, organize, and export crafting systems without spreadsheets.

## Purpose

Cauldron is a developer tool I’m building for cozy and crafting games. It replaces spreadsheets with a visual editor that lets designers drag and drop items, organize recipes by type, and export to CSV or JSON for Unity and Unreal.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript (Frontend)
- Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, and Hosting)
- Vite (Build Tool)

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete crafting recipes
- Assign ingredients and outputs
- Visual preview of recipes
- User authentication
- Real-time database sync with Firebase
- Designed for future backend swap (Node + Express)
